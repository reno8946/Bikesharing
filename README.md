# Bikesharing

## 1. Overview

Citibike runs a bikesharing service in New York City. They are looking to expand the services in other cities around the country and found an angel investor in Des Moines, IA.

The bikesharing project is to analyze New York City CITI Bike data from **August 2019** and then create a proposal on how it may work in Des Moines, IA.

**Tableau Public 2020.3 is used to import, style and portray data accurately using worksheets, dashboards, and stories.**

### 2.1. Bike Utilization:
We start the analysis by looking at bike utilization.

From the data, it looks like bike utilization by bikeID in NYC was quite random and didn't follow any consistent pattern.

### 2.2. Average Trip Duration:
Next, the analysis looked into at average trip duration.

According to the data, there was a huge spike in average trip duration among people born in the very early 1890s, however a consistent increase in average trip duration started to take place from people born in the 1930s and onwards.

### 2.3. Usage Pattern by Hour

Looking at the hourly data for each day of week further confirms that 5-7 PM peak hours is consistent through out the week. It is also observed that Monday through Friday, bikes usage is high during hours of 8-10 AM. 

On Saturdays and Sundays the bikes are used throughout the day. 

It is also interesting to observe that on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, in spite of being work days, the bike usage during hours of 5 - 7PM is higher.

## Summary

The main points that can be derived from the above analysis are:
1. Men tend to use the bikesharing service much more than women.
2. It's important to focus on getting users to convert to subscribers as they tend to most often utilize the bikes a lot more than customers.
3. The bike usage is highest during weekends and during the commute to work during rush hours.

Overall, the August data on the bike sharing service in NYC gave some insights into how the service is used. However, it would be wise to investigate a few more aspects of this service to strengthen the proposal to investors in Des Moines.
1. To make the bike sharing service a viable business through out the year and because NYC and Des Moines experience true winters with snow and bitter cold temperatures, it is important to look into data during the winter months of December and January for example to see how ridership changes during when it becomes cold out.
2. Also, we know that New York city is a very populous city with high traffic. So it makes sense that users in NYC use bikes to get from one place to other. To replicate the same success in Des Moines, it would be wise to perform data analysis on Des Moines, IA population density and traffic patterns to see if it proportionate with that of NYC.
